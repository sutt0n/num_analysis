Bisection Method

- The rules:
-- c = a+b/2
-- f(x) must be continuous (i.e. a polynomial minimum of degree one; e.g. f(x) = x + 2 or something like that)
-- [not implemented, oopsies] neither a or b can be zero; doing so results in an estimated root: 0 < c < 1, which is not allowed
-- other basic mathematical ailments (i.e. no dividing by zero, you goobers)
