Numerical Analysis
==================

My collection of labs for numerical analysis class - mainly to keep here to welcome any critiques/comments/suggestions/edits. Not to give answers, or anything of the sort.

So, here's the thing - you agree (automagically, of course) by viewing this that you're not going to copy this for homework. This is purely for me storing this here on Github. It's here to show what I've done, for others to use to compare what they did, and even critique my code (as I'm sure there's a bug in there somewhere - can't catch them all, unfortunately).
